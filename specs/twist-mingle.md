# Creating Mingle projects

Before your team can start using Mingle, you must create and configure a project. You must be a Mingle administrator to create new projects, and you can create as many projects as you like.

Create new projects from the Current projects page. This is the first page you see after signing in to Mingle.

* Sign in with name "twist" and password "Twist#123"

There are 3 ways you can create project

## Create a new project from template

If you create a project from a template you need to decide which template is best for you.

You can use one of Mingle's pre-configured project templates as a basis for creating your project. These templates are based on a variety of common agile methods and practices. Additionally, your organization may also have created a template or templates specific to your needs. If this is the case check the manage templates page for details of these templates.

* To create a new project, click the New project link on the Current projects page.
